README
This code uses the ortools library to solve three separate mathematical problems (A, B, and C) by defining a set of constraints and finding a valid solution.

Dependencies
This code requires the ortools library to be installed. The recommended method to install the library is to use pip:

Copy code
pip install ortools
Usage
The code can be executed in any Python environment that has the ortools library installed. Simply run the file main.py:

css
Copy code
python main.py
The output will display the solution and the number of variable assignments for each problem.

Explanation
This code uses the constraint programming functionality of the ortools library to solve mathematical problems. For each problem, a set of constraints are defined, which must be satisfied by the variables of the problem. The variables are defined using the IntVar function of the ortools library.

The solveProblem function takes the problem variables, constraints, and the name of the problem as arguments. It creates an instance of the ortools Solver class, adds the constraints to the solver, and calls the getSolution function to find a valid solution.

The getSolution function creates a new instance of the ortools Solver class and defines the search space using the Phase function. It then calls the NewSearch function to start searching for a solution. If a solution is found, it returns the values of the problem variables and the number of variable assignments. If no solution is found, it returns None.

The output of the code is simply the values of the problem variables and the number of variable assignments. If a solution is not found, the output indicates that there is no solution for the problem.
