        "This report aims to analyze the implementation and results of a Bayesian network model constructed to estimate the probability distributions of three variables M1, M2, and M3, given the evidence of N and focus conditions F1, F2, and F3.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Implementation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The Bayesian network structure was created with directed edges from N to M1, M2, and M3, and from F1 to M1, F2 to M2, and F3 to M3.\n",
        "Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) for N, F1, F2, and F3 were created, with N having a uniform distribution across its 7 states (0 to 6) and F1, F2, and F3 having two states each ('in_focus' and 'out_of_focus') with probabilities [0.9, 0.1].\n",
        "CPDs for M1, M2, and M3 were created, taking into account their dependency on N and the respective focus conditions.\n",
        "The CPDs were added to the Bayesian model, and the model was checked for consistency.\n",
        "Inference:\n",
        "Using the Variable Elimination method, the probability distributions for M1, M2, and M3 were inferred given specific evidence. In this case, the evidence was N=3, F1='in_focus', F2='out_of_focus', and F3='in_focus'.\n",
        "\n",
        "Results Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "M1: Given N=3 and F1='in_focus', M1 is most likely in state 3 (probability 0.95) and has a small chance (0.05) of being in state 4. The probabilities for other states are 0.\n",
        "M2: Given N=3 and F2='out_of_focus', M2 has equal probabilities (0.25) of being in states 0, 1, 2, or 3. The probabilities for other states are 0.\n",
        "M3: Given N=3 and F3='in_focus', M3 is most likely in state 3 (probability 0.95) and has a small chance (0.05) of being in state 4. The probabilities for other states are 0.\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "The Bayesian network model successfully estimates the probability distributions of M1, M2, and M3 based on the given evidence. The results suggest that the focus conditions (F1, F2, and F3) have a significant impact on the probabilities of M1, M2, and M3, given the value of N. Further analysis could involve varying the evidence values for N and the focus conditions to better understand the behavior of the model under different circumstances."
